# *Upgrade!* (3D Tower Defense Game)

## About this project

### *Upgrade!* is a fun little project that I decided to start working on to showcase my skills and knowledge inside of the Unity game engine. I've never worked on a tower defense game before but it helps to know about lots of different engine features.

## Description

### Launch explosive balls at enemy cubes that are trying to attack your castle. The explosive balls deal a certain amount of area damage and knockback (depending on stats of selected ball). At the end of each defense round, you can <b>upgrade</b> your castle. The more you <b>upgrade</b>, the higher your rank becomes and you gain access to new items.
